### My Working area
 Do you know what is PUF? You can consider Physically Unclonable Function or PUF as a digital fingerprint. What a digital fingerprint does is to uniquely identify persons uniquely. PUF basically does the same for any device where we can embedd a PUF.
 One can think PUF like a blackbox where there some output (known as Response of a PUF) to some inputs (known as Challenges to a PUF). If you apply same challenge in same PUF over multiple times in same embedded device we should get the same response i.e. reliability of a PUF response should be 100% ideally.
